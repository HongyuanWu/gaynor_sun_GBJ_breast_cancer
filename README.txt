Running the code in the scripts below will reproduce the figures and 
tables from "Identification of differentially expressed gene sets using the Generalized Berk-Jones statistic."
Some of the reference files provide additional background information, and some provide precomputed results
for plotting if you do not wish to run all the code yourself.  
Run make_plots.R last after all the data has been generated.
